## Locales Folder

This folder contains the language files of our project.

This sample project used the [go-i18n library](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) and this library is supports toml. Toml is a file type that is easy to understand and compatible with go.

A separate toml file should be opened for each language.

###Â Naming Conventions

The naming convention for locale files is as follows:

`LANGUAGE_CODE` + `.toml`

For example, if we want to create a locale file for English, we will use the following file name:

`en.toml`
